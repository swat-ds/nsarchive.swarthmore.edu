## National Security Archive Summer Research Internship



The Summer Research Internship offers students the opportunity to learn about Latin American-US relations while engaging in work that expands the capacity of the National Security Archive. Under the supervision of National Security Archive Analyst Carlos Osorio and Swarthmore librarians <span class="redacted">Roberto Vargas</span> and <span class="redacted">Sarah Elichko</span>, interns gain valuable experience working directly with <span class="redacted">declassified government documents</span>, as well as working collaboratively on an interdisciplinary and geographically-distributed team.

<span class="redacted">During the first couple weeks of the internship, interns focus their efforts on developing the background knowledge necessary to meaningfully understa</span>nd the documents with which they will work for the rest of the summer.  They then move into working directly with the primary research materials, largely US government documents (declassified) that the National Security Archive staff have obtained through FOIA requests. Interns access these documents through a secure server hosted by the Archive.

Each week, the NSA interns, Carlos, Roberto, and Sarah meet (remotely/ in-person) to discuss work from the pa<span class="redacted">st week, any questions that have come up, and plans for the next week. To encourage critical reflection on their work, NSA interns periodically submit short response papers related to themes that have come up in the docum</span>ents and discussions. Carlos leads discussion of these papers and themes as part of the weekly meetings. In between these meetings, Roberto and Sarah check in regularly with the interns.
